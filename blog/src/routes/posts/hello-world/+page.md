Starting a blog was on my list of things to do for a long time. For years there where challenges
that I faced that I did regret later not documenting, because the solutions I figured out are now
hard or impossible to retrieve.

Some new technologies, things that I have learnt recently, some good blogs[^1], and Mark Christian's
recent post ([You should have a personal web site](https://writing.markchristian.org/2019/04/29/personal-web-sites/))
motivated me to start this blog (I've had a personal [website](https://www.geritol.tech) for some time now, but no blog recently).

## What to expect

Most probably will write some how-tos about software engineering related stuff.
Also I will probably write on some of my projects and ideas.
