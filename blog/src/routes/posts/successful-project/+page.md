I started writing this blog post in early 2020 when we where in the middle of a big and chaotic project with my teammates.

Delivery wise, the project turned out okay (lots of stuff could have been done better, but it worked). This required lots of independent effort and individuals even outside of the team coming up with homegrown solutions to pain points with the project.

We felt that with better management and organization lots of stress could've been prevented and we could have achieved a better end result.  
People wise the project lead to the disintegration of the team.

I have never finished that post, since I could never find time an energy to go deeper on the original notes/bulletpoints I have laid out during the project. However I find it important to finalize these notes since it might become helpful in later projects.

After reviewing the notes I found that it might be the best to publish them in their original form, with minor typo fixes and examples where needed, since the notes are an easy read an most of the times do not require additional explanation/examples.

Good management can spare a lot of effort and frustration for a software development team.
I am trying to collect the stuff I think is important to lead a successful project.

- Communication
  - Single place for project related (internal and external) documentation
    - ideally a confluence page or a github repo
    - (not random urls in various slack channels)
  - Clear project goals and milestones
  - Clear responses to feature requests (eg. we are thinking on solutions, we have a solution and plan to implement it in 2 weeks or it is not on our roadmap, versus some generic "we are working on it")
- Transparency (be honest as fuck)
- Try to have as many questions a possible early

  - What do we need to do?
  - Why do we need x?
  - How important is z?
  - Can we cut corners? (delay decision/implementation till we have more information)
  - Think/ research/ pose questions before jumping into developing
  - Embrace questions

- At the beginning try to develop as less a possible, avoid long living POCs. If you write code that lives longer than a week make it adhere to the standards (clean, tested code). Be really strict with your MVP
- Make priorities crystal clear, avoid changing them frequently
